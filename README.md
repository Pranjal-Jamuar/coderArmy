🚀 A C++ playground for learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains my personal DSA practice — starting with logic building, patterns, loops, conditionals, and gradually moving into arrays, recursion, dynamic programming, and more.

---

## 📌 Current Focus
- ✅ Logic building
- ✅ Pattern problems (stars, numbers, pyramids)
- 🔜 Loops, conditionals, arrays

---

## 📂 Folder Structure
/patterns → Pattern printing problems
/main.cpp → Quick tests / scratchpad
/CMakeLists.txt → CLion config


---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Language: **C++20**
- IDE: **CLion**
- Build System: **CMake**
- OS: macOS (Apple Silicon M4)

---

## ✍️ Notes
This repo is for **self-practice only**. Commit history will reflect progress over time. Contributions are not open — but you're welcome to peek for learning.

---

## 🔖 To-Do
- [ ] Add array and string problems
- [ ] Add README in `/patterns`
- [ ] Try recursion problems
- [ ] Explore STL containers

---

## 💡 Tip
> "Patterns teach you to control flow before you try to conquer recursion." – Every DSA mentor ever.
